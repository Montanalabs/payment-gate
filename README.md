# Payments service

A **hybrid** injection-safe service — the architecture recommended for real Ondos apps:
privilege **centralized** in one module, each feature a **vertical slice** that co-locates
its own trust boundary, and an injection-safe router.

```
main.os           import router; route()
  router.os       the route selector is UNTRUSTED -> extract<Endpoint> -> match -> slice
  payments.os          feature slice: closed type + quarantined { extract } + using settle { commit }
  refunds.os          feature slice: closed type + quarantined { extract } + using refund { commit }
  capabilities.os EVERY grant (the whole privileged surface) + the program budget
```

- **Capabilities (centralized):** `settle`, `refund` — all grants in one auditable file, each irreversible with a cost + confidence floor, bounded by `budget 100`.
- **Feature slices (co-located boundary):** each owns its closed type and attenuates to just its own capability via `using` — a slice literally cannot call another's sink (the checker rejects it).
- **Injection-safe routing:** the route itself is extracted into a closed `Endpoint` set, so a request can't dispatch itself to an arbitrary handler.

## Routes

| Route | Closed command | Sink |
|-------|----------------|------|
| `Payments` | `PayDecision = Approve(PayTier) | Review | Deny` | `settle` |
| `Refunds` | `RefundDecision = Refund(RefundTier) | Reject` | `refund` |

## Run the demo

```sh
examples/services/payment-gate/demo.sh
```

Proves `SAFE`, runs both routes, and rejects an injected route at the boundary (exit 3).
The `unsafe.os` variant — which imports the centralized capabilities and calls a sink
with untrusted data directly — proves `UNSAFE`: the checker follows taint **across
modules**, so neither layering nor centralizing can hide misuse from it.

## Files

- `capabilities.os` — the centralized privileged surface (grants + budget).
- `payments.os` / `refunds.os` — the feature slices (each a self-contained trust boundary).
- `router.os` — injection-safe dispatch (extracts the untrusted route).
- `main.os` — entry point · `unsafe.os` — the negative example · `ondos.toml` — the manifest.
